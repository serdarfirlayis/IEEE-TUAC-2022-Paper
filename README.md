Legal processes take an important place in the lives of individuals and institutions. With the widespread use of computers, the transfer of texts obtained from legal processes to digital media is also accelerating. This allows us to obtain useful results with natural language processing methods on legal texts. In many languages, studies such as text classification, text generation, question answering, and finding similar texts are carried out. The positive effects of these studies on the legal systems of countries will gain more importance in the future. However, NLP studies with Turkish Law texts are not sufficient. In this article, the Turkish Legal Documents Corpus (TLDC) was created from individual application cases of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Turkey to contribute to the studies in the field of NLP in Turkish Law. Visualizations (WordCloud, Correlation) were made to understand the data set better. To estimate the case outcomes, binary classification was made. Classes were ”violation” and ”no violation” of the case outcomes. TFIDF is used for vectorizing the text. After vectorization, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models are trained. In addition, the neural network was trained by performing feature extraction with LABSE and Glove models.
